This web app will predict the price of a used car based on various factors like the model of the car, purchase year, selling price of the car, type of gear in the car, the number of miles the car has been driven, type of fuel for the car, road tax paid last year, miles per gallon given by car, size of the engine and brand of the car. It will help people to know the actual worth of a used car before buying or selling their car to make better decisions.

The dataset used for this project is the Kaggle Dataset collected by Aditya Desai (https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes) updated 2 years ago for gaining insights and making visualizations of used cars data for educational and research purposes. The dataset has 13 files each separated by the brand of the car, we will be combining all the files into a single table and then making our predictions on it.

The Web App lets you records the user’s prediction history and stores it in the database, predict the value of a car under various constraints or to change the user’s previous selection, users will be able to update the information form they submitted, delete their search history after logging into their accounts, and read functionalities will be provided for the criteria provided by users to predict the value of a car. Advanced options include Car Price Prediction. 

This project was done as part of the project requirement in the Applied Database Technologies course.
